# Kanban Board

A simple and interactive Kanban board where you can create, manage, and drag-and-drop tasks between different statuses. This app helps you organize your tasks into multiple stages like "To Do", "In Progress", "Peer Review", and "Done".

## Features

- **Search Tasks**: Filter tasks by name using the search bar.
- **Task Management**: Add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between different statuses (To Do, In Progress, Peer Review, Done).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
